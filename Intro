1. No one can save you except yourself.

2. Live for yourself 

It's not important how others think of you.
It's important that how you think of yourself.
You're invincible if you care nothing.

We as an individual are so insignificant compared 
to the universal. 

Think like this way: if you're tall/short, you're 
born with that. You can do nothing with that. For the
thing which you have no control just let it be.
Think on the other side the current you is actually the
perfect you.

You only can control yourself. You have no control of others whether 
what they think or do. So focus on the thing which you have control 
and ignore whatever you have no control.
